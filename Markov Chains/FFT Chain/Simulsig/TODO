4. Ensure only one clustered MFCC of values 0
5. currently need > 1 training file
Disseration idea

1. lin iterp between FFT frames in syntehsis stage
2. talk about different clustering algo/initialization types
3. hop overlap sort out for player, inverse fft etc
4. sort out proper mfcc coef
5. Attempt landmark MDS . Stopped at MDS. LMDS beyond scope


multidimensional transform. 

<- mds can do in matlab. find all similar aspect ins data, create visualizations. . then you get a represent of how far each is away in relation .  looks at in 50 d space, works out distance .  one . pick anyy db element at random. get distance get dist from all frames in dataase.t  find out the best places. desnsely.  ... whcih frames has has numbers. 
    
euclid distance point source -> every targe. the ones wiht smallest distance represent desired markov states. only works with mds?
    one distance for everypoint->everpoint , find 
    each point will have nearest 40 points. group these together?
    
 find the largest distances betwen these multi-clusters. make them centroids

 LDA
 linear discriminitve analysis
 
 
 quantize from mds output to make states 
 
 depth of markov model. how many orders? or find a way assumign that each mactch can be x numner of frames long.  
 how do i decide how much audio to play back given a match.

 
 
 
 // pass in markov chain play results into a markov player. take the fft frames ( remember the overlap.. ) to produce
